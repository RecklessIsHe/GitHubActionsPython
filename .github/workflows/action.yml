# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.
# This workflow does a number of things:
#   - Run the python script (sample dice roll)
#   - Build a Docker Image and push to GH Packages
#   - Build a Docker Image and push to Docker Hub
#   - Run "pylint" on the python scripts in the "test" folder
